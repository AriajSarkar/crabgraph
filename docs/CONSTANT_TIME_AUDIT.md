# Constant-Time Operations Audit

This document tracks constant-time comparison usage throughout CrabGraph to ensure protection against timing attacks.

## Overview

Timing attacks exploit the fact that certain operations (like comparisons) take different amounts of time depending on the input values. By measuring these timing differences, attackers can potentially extract secret information.

**Critical**: Any comparison involving secret values MUST use constant-time operations.

## Constant-Time Guarantees

### ✅ Fully Protected (Constant-Time)

#### 1. **MAC Verification** (`src/mac/mod.rs`)
- **Function**: `hmac_sha256_verify()`, `hmac_sha512_verify()`
- **Mechanism**: Uses `hmac` crate's `verify_slice()` which uses `subtle::ConstantTimeEq`
- **Status**: ✅ Constant-time via audited `hmac` crate
- **Test Coverage**: RFC 4231 test vectors verify correctness

#### 2. **AEAD Authentication** (`src/aead/`)
- **AES-GCM**: `aes-gcm` crate uses constant-time tag verification
- **ChaCha20-Poly1305**: `chacha20poly1305` crate uses constant-time tag verification
- **Mechanism**: Both crates use `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` for tag comparison
- **Status**: ✅ Constant-time via audited RustCrypto crates

#### 3. **Signature Verification** (`src/asym/`)
- **Ed25519**: `ed25519-dalek` uses `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` internally
- **RSA-PSS**: `rsa` crate uses constant-time signature verification
- **Status**: ✅ Constant-time via audited crates

#### 4. **Custom Comparisons** (`src/utils/mod.rs`)
- **Function**: `constant_time_eq()`
- **Mechanism**: Uses `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` (industry standard)
- **Status**: ✅ Constant-time via audited `subtle` crate v2.6
- **Usage**: Available for user-level secret comparisons

### ⚠️ Not Constant-Time (By Design - Non-Secret Data)

#### 1. **Public Key Comparisons**
- Comparing public keys, nonces, IDs uses standard `==`
- **Rationale**: Public data doesn't need timing protection
- **Examples**: 
  - `Ed25519PublicKey::as_bytes()` comparison
  - `X25519PublicKey::as_bytes()` comparison
  - Nonce/IV comparisons in AEAD

#### 2. **Length Checks**
- All length comparisons use standard `==`
- **Rationale**: Lengths are not secret in most protocols
- **Note**: Early-return on length mismatch before constant-time comparison is acceptable

#### 3. **Test Assertions**
- All `assert_eq!` in tests use standard comparison
- **Rationale**: Test data is not secret

## Implementation Details

### Subtle Crate Integration

```rust
use subtle::ConstantTimeEq;

pub fn constant_time_eq(a: &[u8], b: &[u8]) -> bool {
    if a.len() != b.len() {
        return false;  // Length check is not secret-dependent
    }
    a.ct_eq(b).into()  // Constant-time comparison via subtle
}
```

### Dependencies Using Constant-Time Comparisons

All our cryptographic dependencies use constant-time operations where required:

| Crate | Version | Constant-Time Method | Status |
|-------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| `hmac` | 0.12 | `verify_slice()` via `subtle` | ✅ Audited |
| `aes-gcm` | 0.10 | Tag verification via `subtle` | ✅ Audited |
| `chacha20poly1305` | 0.10 | Tag verification via `subtle` | ✅ Audited |
| `ed25519-dalek` | 2.1 | Signature verification via `subtle` | ✅ Audited |
| `rsa` | 0.9 | Signature verification (with caveats*) | ⚠️ See RUSTSEC-2023-0071 |
| `subtle` | 2.6 | Core constant-time primitives | ✅ Audited |

*Note: RSA has known Marvin timing attack vulnerability (RUSTSEC-2023-0071). Use Ed25519 when possible.

## Verification Strategy

### Automated Checks

We use the following strategies to ensure constant-time correctness:

1. **Dependency Auditing**: `cargo audit` checks for known vulnerabilities
2. **RFC Test Vectors**: Verify correct behavior (including timing-safe paths)
3. **Code Review**: Manual inspection of all secret comparisons
4. **Clippy Lints**: Catch accidental use of `==` on secret types

### Manual Review Checklist

When adding new cryptographic operations:

- [ ] Does the operation compare secret values?
- [ ] If yes, is it using a constant-time comparison?
- [ ] Are we using audited crate methods (preferred)?
- [ ] If implementing custom comparison, is it using `subtle`?
- [ ] Are there any early returns based on secret-dependent conditions?
- [ ] Are error messages revealing secret information?

## Known Limitations

### 1. Cache Timing
While we prevent timing leaks from comparison operations, we don't protect against cache timing attacks. This would require:
- Constant-time memory access patterns
- Cache-line aligned operations
- Specialized hardware/software countermeasures

**Mitigation**: Use hardware AES-NI when available (automatic in RustCrypto crates).

### 2. RSA Side-Channels
The `rsa` crate has a known Marvin timing attack vulnerability in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption (RUSTSEC-2023-0071). We use RSA-OAEP which is not affected by this specific vulnerability, but RSA in general is more vulnerable to side-channels than modern algorithms.

**Mitigation**: Prominently document RSA limitations and recommend Ed25519/X25519.

### 3. Compiler Optimizations
Constant-time code can potentially be optimized away by the compiler. The `subtle` crate uses inline assembly and volatile operations to prevent this.

**Mitigation**: Use `subtle` crate which handles this correctly.

## Testing

### Constant-Time Test Coverage

```bash
# Run all tests including RFC vectors (which exercise constant-time paths)
cargo test --all-features

# Specific constant-time utility tests
cargo test --lib utils::tests

# MAC verification tests (constant-time critical)
cargo test --lib mac::tests
```

### Manual Timing Analysis

For critical applications, consider using tools like:
- **dudect**: Statistical timing leak detection
- **ctgrind**: Valgrind plugin for constant-time verification
- **timecop**: Rust-specific constant-time verification

Example with dudect:
```bash
# Not currently implemented, but would be:
cargo test --features timing-analysis
```

## Future Work

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Add dudect-based timing leak tests
- [ ] Implement constant-time conditional select utilities
- [ ] Add fuzzing for timing invariants
- [ ] Document cache-timing considerations for each algorithm

### Potential Enhancements
- [ ] Add `#[must_use]` on constant_time_eq to prevent ignoring result
- [ ] Create type-safe wrappers that enforce constant-time (e.g., `Secret<T>`)
- [ ] Integrate with `secrecy` crate for better secret handling
